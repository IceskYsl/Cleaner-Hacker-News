Cleaner Hacker News is a loose collection of CSS rules that you can use to improve the style of Hacker News (http://hackerne.ws or http://news.ycombinator.com).

The styles improve the legibility of the page by:

 * replacing Verdana with Lucida Grande and tweaking the font size; Lucida Grande is narrower than Verdana and easier to read
 * giving everything more room to breathe
 * removing the container color so there's no longer a border to the left of the list of submitted articles
 * reduces the contrast of each item's number and increases the contrast of links so the page becomes easier to scan

See screenshot.png for a preview of how it looks in Google Chrome.

Tested in Google Chrome v16 on Mac OS X.

To apply the styles in Google Chrome, install the Stylebot extension (https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/oiaejidbmkiecgbjeifoejpgmdaleoha), head to Hacker News, click the Stylebot button in the address bar (the one that says "css"), click Edit Css at the bottom, and then paste the contents of cleaner-hn.css.
